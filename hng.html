          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>Hunt &#38; Gather is and End-to End design of an immersive Community-based Scavenger Hunt app where users have easy and assessible ways to support their communities through exploration, volunteerism, and supporting local and small
            businesses
            alone or with a group of friends.</p>

          <div class="">
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>I believe users need to have easy access to improve their communities through Volunteerism as well as taking part in vital community events. Users will also have the added bonus of Connection and Exploration where they can
              interactively explore alone or with a group, new parts of the community while enjoying local food and activities in the process.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Develop an app that will allow users to support and engage in their local communities. Users will have access to local community organizations, that they can sign up to Volunteer with or Donate directly to. They will also have the
              added bonus of enjoying the Scavenger Hunts where they can setup local activities and meet in local areas where they can complete scavenger activities alone or in teams or they can just explore local food or activities together.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Laying the Foundation</p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

          <p>With so many concepts and ideas already taking up space in my head I know I needed to first lay the foundation, so I began with a thorough Competitive Analysis. I complete a Competitive and Market Analysis of several Scavenger Hunt apps.
            I decided to focus on the two most popular and most downloaded apps. For further research and understanding of both the apps I also completed SWOT &#38; UX Analysis.

            I quickly discovered that most of the Scavenger Hunt Apps emphasized travel and special events and lacked community. The pre-curated and difficult to navigate apps left little room for customization or detours along the way. Along with
            the added price tag they seemed to be lacking incentives to keep users coming back for more.</p>

            <h3>User Surveys</h3>
            <p>I followed up my initial research with User Surveys which gave me better insight on how involved users are with their communities and how often they meet up with family and friends. The results were mixed on some aspects, but it
              provided the information needed to generate more detailed questions for the interview phase.</p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>User Interviews proved to be very successful, although the results were mixed it provided me with detailed insight on how involved users are with their communities. I found that all interviewees were interested in the idea of engaging
              ways to invest in their communities more often with family and friends. I also found that most volunteered they just needed a better way to find access to different local organizations.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <p>After organizing and analyzing all the User Research Data gathered, I completed an Affinity Mapping and divided key and overlapping points into four main categories. Some common themes that came up from the Affinity mapping were Filters
            &#38; Themes, Challenges, Community and Connection. From this mapping I was able to get a better understanding of who a potential user would be, thus laying the foundation for the Persona Development.</p>

          <div class="">
            <h4>Filters &#38; Themes</h4>

          <div class="">
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>App should include options for those that are very competitive and want to be able to have games that are challenging.</p>

            <p>With the interviews fresh in my mind and app concept of Connection through Community as my guide I was ready to develop the User Personas that would better help me to constantly envision the audience that I am ideally creating the app

            <p>User flows were compiled to give a more specific understanding of what the user would accomplish in the Hunt &#38; Gather app and how the user would go about completing the task successfully. These flows were defined through the
              process of
              creating specific Persona Objectives for specific activities that would be completed in the app.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h3>Sitemaps</h3>
            <p>Diving deeper into the Architecture I began the process of gathering content audit info to better assist in the creation of a user friendly and intuitive sitemap for the Hunt &#38; Gather app. This process was completed twice,
              initially I
              created a sitemap based on my idea of how the app should flow. I then wanted further insight to see if my thoughts were as user friendly and intuitive as I thought they were. I utilized the card sorting method via Optimal sort and the
              results helped me to better define and outline the site map.</p>

            <h3>Logo Development</h3>
            <p>After settling on the new name Hunt &#38; Gather I began sketching out ideas for the logo. I wanted the logo to have some interesting vintage flare but also give users a glimpse of what to expect in the app. I was able to execute my
              idea
              successfully and prepare it so that it could be included in the Mid-Fidelity Wireframing process.</p>

              main processes of the app.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>I developed a usability test plan and recruited six participants ranging in age as well as technical skillset. The testing was completed in two days and the goals and objectives for testing were as follows:</p>
          <p>Goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determine usability; are the testers able to navigate through each screen efficiently.</li>
            <li>Determine if users find the features easy to learn or are the steps too complicated to process through their tasks efficiently. </li>
            <li>Determine the testers views of the design, do they feel it to be pleasing or distracting.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Objectives</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To successfully process through the selection and sign up for a Volunteer Assignment.</li>
            <li>To successfully navigate through the setup for creating a city scavenger hunt.</li>
            <li>To successfully navigate through and complete a community-based Scavenger Hunt.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Findings</h3>
          <p>Observations from results were recorded and analyzed using both the Rainbow Spreadsheet and another round of affinity mapping. Results were mostly positive but there were some features and functionalities that proved to collectively be
            too complicated and distracting to the testers.
            With pain points being thoroughly identified I updated mid-fidelity wireframes and completed another round of testing. This time I did so by utilizing the A/B preference testing via Usability Hub on app pain point identified via testing.
            It took two more rounds of prototype testing for me to get to a place where I was comfortable proceeding to build out the High-Fidelity version of the app via Figma.</p>

              <p>Adapting time to Testers Technical Skillsets. There were instances where tester went over designated time due to technical skill level. Although it was very beneficial to determine how to make the app more intuitive for the less
                technical user as well it did create a time management issue.</p>

              <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>Preparation, Organization, Communication and time management is key when conducting and scheduling User testing.
                The testing phase is very important seeing and hearing your implemented ideas in action and receiving different perspectives and insight is vital in creating a more intuitive user-friendly design.</p>

              Human Interface Guidelines. To help me further with the High Fidelity Wireframing process I Collaborated with fellow Designers to act as testers and give some constructive feedback on their thoughts and suggestions on the design and
              feel of the app and the processes.
              I received some very valuable feedback which I then incorporated into the final iteration of the Hunt &#38; Gather App. The final product went through several rounds of iterations, but I finally got it to the point where I was ready to
              present the product. </p>

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>It will be a constant struggle to settle on a final design. There is constantly insight or suggestions or things that can work or look better.</p>

              <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>Always keep both Human Centered Guidelines and WCAG standards in close reach. There were many instances where I had to complete several iterations of app features and processes because I wasn't constantly referencing this
                documentation.</p>

            <h2>Final Analysis</h2>
            <p>From Discovery to the final Prototype Presentation, I feel I have created an experience that users will enjoy. Through the design, testing and collaboration phases I received valuable information that aided in creating the final Hunt
              &#38;
              Gather experience. I believe I have reached the initial goal for users to have access to an app and experience that bridges the gap between Community and Connection. </p>
