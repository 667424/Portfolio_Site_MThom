              <h2>How's It Going ?!?</h2>
              <p>I am Moriah a UX designer new to the scene but ready to immerse myself completely in all the Wonders UX has to offer. In my previous career I was a Software Implementation Consultant, and here is where I began to truly experience technology from the perspective of a user. I experienced their apprehension of completely disrupting their world of familiarity. I experienced their fluctuations of anxiety as I walked them through the new software features, and I also experience their relief as I talked through and showed them some familiar and improved features. They also experienced my surprise and admiration as they demonstrated how they uniquely customized or repurposed features to meet their needs. This is where my journey to UX truly began without me even realizing it. I have had the unique advantage of seeing the software design perspective from both sides. As I design, I am always brought back to these experiences they help me to see from so many different perspectives and help me to develop the utmost respect and appreciation for design on all sides. I enjoy being in the place where I can bridge the gap and create experiences that not only meet Business requirements, but I can help create experiences that are truly intuitive, beautiful and User Centered.
